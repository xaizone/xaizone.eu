i really wanted a finalmouse mouse for a long time, but never got my head around to spend double or sometimes even triple the msrp to some reseller, but on the last drop (poseidon) i got lucky and got one. i originally wanted to get the medium size, which would probably be WAY better for any adult with normal hand size, but i was unlucky and it was sold out before i got to pay my order, so i at least got the small one.

since i'm from europe i had to pay import fees, so the final price was around *220â‚¬* - that's quite a lot of money considering it's just a mouse, but you get what you pay for, packaging got the "apple vibe", you open the box and the mouse is just nicely sitting there in all of it's glory, it was really nice.

as i mentioned above, i wanted to get the medium size, but it was sold out before i got to pay so i settled on the small one, it's way too small for me, i believe way too small for everyone with normal hands, i tried corepad grips, they don't help much with making the mouse bigger. this itself makes the mouse unusable for me, since i can't grip the mouse comfortably. adding honeycomb design on top of that makes it **super** uncomfortable to use the mouse, since the honeycomb edges are quite sharp (*thanks to magnesium*), the mouse will dig into your fingers, which makes it uncomfortable to use even for small amount of time.

clicks are really nice, i've always been a big fan of kailh gm 8.0s, i had them on my xm1r and on my modded g305 and i've always loved them, the same applies to the finalmouse, the clicks are well tuned. i was suprised how crispy the side buttons were, no pre-travel or post-travel.

finalmouse had big issues with qc in the past and it hasn't changed much on this newer model. i must say i got pretty lucky with my copy, my mousewheel is pretty much dead center, just a tiny bit off to the right. i've seen pictures of people's poseidons where the mousewheel touches the main buttons, something like this is unacceptable for such a premium price tag and it should be their main focus for future releases.

as i mentioned in the beginning of the review, you can only get this mouse in drops, and the drops are also limited to number of pieces, which makes it almost impossible to get one (if you want to pay an "acceptable" amount of money), but on the other hand every mouse is unique, with their colorways and a serial number on the bottom of each mouse.

tl;dr not really worth the huge hype imo, but overall really good & unique mouse, persisting qc issues, small is more like tiny
