i sparked interest in this mouse long time ago, i believe after seeing boardzy's review, i thought the interchangable shell design was a good concept and believed it might be the future of mouse design (which isn't :sadge:).

i bought this mouse on sale for about *45â‚¬*, i originally wanted to buy the wireless variant which should be coming out at the time of writing this review, but after seeing the wired version go on sale i didn't wait and bought one.

at first i thought i'm gonna hate the cable since i was exclusively using wireless mice for over a year, i was actually pleasantly surprised by the cable, it didn't bother me at all. the cable is stiff, but still soft and doesn't get in the way as long as you are using a bungee (i had this issue with on my old xm1, where the cable constantly got in the way when lifting the mouse up, since the cable was way too soft).

i got the retro edition colorway, the mouse looks really nice and unique, rgb effects are also really good-looking.

changing shells on the go is super easy, i much prefer the one with the smaller hump, the one with the higher hump was a bit too much for me and it made me fail to grip the mouse properly. smaller hump shell allowed me to do both relaxed and aggressive claw grip. 

one thing i have to complain about is the lod of the sensor, coming from logitech where the lod is super super low, to the point where even slightly lifting the mouse causes you to skip tracking. the lod on this mouse is relatively high compared to logitech as mentioned above (it's still pretty low, but still a downgrade over the more modern mice), the lod was around 1mm. the mouse recalibrates it's lod everytime you plug it in, the lod doesn't adjust on the go, only when you plug it in, which makes the lod change everytime you restart your pc.

everything is configurable on the mouse itself, you don't need to download anything. everything was well described in the manual.

tl;dr: good mouse with unique design and a good shape, perfect for claw grip, higher lod
