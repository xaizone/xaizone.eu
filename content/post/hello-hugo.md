description: "I switched away from Jekyll to Hugo and some other info."
---

I've been using Jekyll to run this website for around a year (~) and I was thinking about switching to something new - so I picked Hugo!

Hugo really sparked my interest, mainly thanks to it's insanely fast build speeds and it being cross-platform.

Working with Hugo has been really great so far, it's different from Jekyll, but still fairly similar. It feels like I've only touched the surface of what you can do with Hugo by making this website and I constantly keep learning new stuff.

Also with this switch comes a *slight* overhaul of this site - even more minimal now! .... and you are able to lookup posts by tags (they are still very useless for the time being, but hopefully in the future they will be more useful.)

I will try to post more stuff (soonTM), I got some nice ideas.

Thank you for reading.
