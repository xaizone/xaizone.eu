I had an eye on this mouse since it's release and when the first reviews started rolling out I was completely sold and just waited for the mouse to get in stock on Maxgaming (Europe). I got the mouse in late December of 2022 and I absolutely fell in love with it.

The shape is perfect for claw grip, just like the XM1r was. Well this mouse is basically the EGG XM1r, but with upgraded internals and most importantly - wireless. Personally I really hope the XM2w is gonna be at least as good as the Atlantis. What I am not able to praise on this mouse is the coating. The mouse is very slippery with dry hands to the point where you are not able to grip the mouse comfortably at all (aggressive claw grip), but at least decent grips are included with the mouse, that fix the issue at the cost of ruining the looks (not like you really care). The mouse is really light and dead center balanced.

In the pluses I've mentioned the packaging. All I can say is WOW. You get a lot of accessories - extra PTFE skates (+ dot PTFE skates), mouse grips (as I mentioned above) and a carrying bag (? i think rofl). The included cable and dongle is amazing and looks really nice on the desk. The cable is slightly bent upwards so you can charge and play at the same time.

After mentioning charging and playing at the same time I have to talk about the battery life. After maining the GPX for 2 years, I am kind of spoiled by the battery life and it's definitely nothing alike. It's not THAT bad, but you still have to charge the mouse every 2-3 days, if you play a decent amount hours, something where the GPX wouldn't need to be charged for the next 2 weeks.

I'm not going to talk about the other internals, everything feels dialed in and well implemented, so there's not much to cover or to talk about.

Now after the release of the EGG XM2we is this mouse still worth it? Yes and No. Personally I think you are better by buying the EGG XM2we (the one with PixArt 3370) and save yourself 30€ for (almost) the same mouse.

tl;dr: really good claw grip mouse, impressive packaging with a lot of accessories, subpar battery life, "atrocious" coating, save yourself 30€ and buy the EGG XM2we.
