so almost a year ago (I actually had to double check the order date on MaxGaming, because it really felt like I ordered this mouse a decade ago - order placed 2023-11-22, 21:47) I bought the LAMZU Atlantis Mini 4K and this mouse has really grown on me.

I have to start with the unboxing experience, it feels as nice as the other LAMZU mouse I have reviewed in the past, the [LAMZU Atlantis OG V1](/post/lamzu-atlantis-review/). You get a nice premium packaging with a lot of accessories included - such as extra PTFE skates, dot PTFE skates, mouse grips and a carrying bag. The packaging is basically the same as the LAMZU Atlantis OG, which is really nice and it impressed me once again.

I'm not going to talk about my first impressions, since I don't even remember what they were almost a year ago, but even now after all this time on this mouse, I can say this feels like home. No other mouse has yet to beat this awesome shape, it fits pretty much perfectly into the hand of everybody I gave this mouse to. The mouse almost forces you to claw grip, which, in my opinion, is the best overall grip style.

For the price you get internals that are basically the best you can get in this day and age. PixArt 3395, nice feeling clicks, good battery life, Nordic MCU supporting 4K polling. Talking about the polling rate, the 4K implementation is great and I didn't have any issues with it, the only issue which is tied to the polling rate, that I've already mentioned in the cons above is the battery life, but to be fair this is expected and it shouldn't really be taken as a con. 4K polling basically discharges the battery 4x faster than 1K polling, so you go from about 1-2 weeks battery life to around 1-2 days depending on use, but honestly 4K polling is barely noticeable even on 480hz OLED and it's mostly a marketing speech :)

As I mentioned in the pros above, the mouse feet "setup" is great. I'm not really sure how you should properly call this, but the cutouts on the bottom of the mouse for the feet are not as deep, so you can use pretty much any feet and they will pretty much never scratch the base. For example I had an issue with the Logitech G Pro X Superlight where fresh skates would start to touch the base of the mouse fairly quickly, making me go through skates a lot quicker, especially paired with a hardpad. I have been using the Wallhack Pro UHMW-PE Mouse Skates, paired with the WALLHACK SP004 and I haven't changed the skates in over 3 months of fairly active use. (Maybe that's just the skates durability though :P)

I had some issues with the coating on the original LAMZU Atlantis. I have no issues on this one, the coating feels great, and I didn't even need to think about using any grips.

My biggest downside is the software. Obviously I'm spoiled by Wooting and their Wootility so anything else is going to feel pretty awful. This mouse comes with your average generic Nordic MCU software that you have to install on your Windows machine. Firmware update is also a separate EXE that you have to download and overall it's really confusing to use. It's usable, but very confusing at first, at the same time though, you mostly setup your mouse once and then never touch the sofware again.

TL;DR: The best claw grip mouse - I really mean it, this mouse has been my main for almost a year now, and it's not going to change anytime soon; impressive packaging with a lot of accessories, poor battery life at 4k polling rate, okay software.
