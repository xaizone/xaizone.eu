description: "Wayland/Hyprland First Impressions."

Wayland has really come a long way, I must say. At the very least, it feels on-par with X11, if not better. (Well... for general use that is, like browsing & coding. I have yet to try playing games.) I tried playing around with [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org) and the experience was not too bad. I'm really impressed by the smoothness of the animations and the fact that setting a monitor to the highest refresh rate required me to replace 1 word in the configuration file. The Hyprland documentation can be a little funky at times, but despite this, I might still make it my daily driver and see what the future uncovers.
