This is a list of single-player and co-op games with actual endings that I've completed (or almost completed). Nowadays, I mostly play roguelikes, which I'm obviously not including here since they have infinite replayability. As you can see, most of the games in the list below have some columns that are either empty or contain a question mark suffix. Iâ€™m not sure how long they take to beat if played on a console, as I played most of them during my childhood. However, I still felt like including them because they hold a special place in my heart.

Additionally, I've tried to include a simple Steam Deck "playability" rating for most of the recent games or games I've emulated, since it has pretty much become my main gaming machine now.
