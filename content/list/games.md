This is a list of singleplayer and co-op games with actual ending, that I've completed (or almost completed). Nowadays I mostly play roguelikes, which I'm obviously not including here since they have infinite replayability. As you can see most of the games in the list below don't have an exact date or even a year of completion, the reasons are: 1) I have no idea how long it took them to beat if they were played on a console 2) I've played through most of the games in my childhood, but I still felt like including them since they have a special place in my heart.

I also try to include a very simple Steam Deck "playability" rating on most of the recent games, since that pretty much became my main gaming device now.
