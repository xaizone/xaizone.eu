Hey,

I changed the structure of my website a tiny bit - mainly I added a new section called [update](/update), where I moved these small update articles that basically just flood the main post section. (such as this one you are currently reading).

I also changed the tags on some of the articles to make more sense and removed some of my old bad articles :) And that's basically it. I'm also thinking about moving my reviews into a separate section as well, we will see in the future.

See you soon.
