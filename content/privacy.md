I collect very basic access logs through Nginx's core functionality (access_log) on this website, this log contains IP addresses, browser user agents and which page has been visited. All IP addresses are obfuscated.

I then use a really cool CLI tool [GoAccess](https://goaccess.io/) to get all my necessary analytics - most notably number of hits on individual pages.

All access logs are kept for exactly 30 days and are not shared with anybody or used for any other purpose.

If you still have any concerns about your privacy, feel free to contact me - you can find all my contact information [here](/contact).
