Privacy and data security are very important to me, and I take them seriously.

Like most websites, I collect basic access logs through the webserver's core functionality. These logs include IP addresses, browser user agents, and details about which pages or resources were accessed. However, this webserver is behind a reverse proxy, meaning that all logged IP addresses are obfuscated.

To analyze this data, I use a powerful CLI tool called [GoAccess](https://goaccess.io), which helps me track essential metrics, such as the number of hits on individual pages.

All access logs are retained for a period of 30 days and are not shared with anyone or used for any other purposes.

For full transparency, I must mention third parties:

Once you click on a link which leads to another website, you enter their jurisdiction and are subject to their privacy policies.
